## Founders and Coders Training

A starting point for everyone interested in running a training workshop. 

All resources used in training exercises must be accompanied with a detailed README and instructions for use. 

When delivering training consider:
- Not everything can be written for reference. *Be over-prepared*.
    - Let the README for each specific training project be written as losely as possible. 
- Teach best practice from the very beginning. (To this end - *know best practice*).
- It's all new and confusing - Unless you point it out, I'm not gonna read it.
- Start with the simplest thing.
- For particulary involved or complex parts:
    - Take the lead and direct.
    - To that end always develop the structure and **problem-solving process** with your direction. This way, should someone miss a step, or want to repeat the process later, they know the path to follow and the tools to refer to.
