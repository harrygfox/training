## Introduction

This will be part 1 of a 2 part workshop in which we will undergo a miniaturised version of the process of defining and designing the user experience (UX) visitors to a website will have. For more on our interna UX process see:

> Recently I have secured investment to expand over the boarder and into England. However, my investors are only willing to part with their cash on the proviso that I intorduce a new, vegan, Ã¼ber-healthy range of candies. This new healthy range of sweets will mean I'll be breaking into a new market of health-conscious fatties. Obviously I don't want to isolate my regular devoted fatties, however.

> I've never operated a business in England before, but I have plenty of customers who travel with their kids from that green and pleasant land just to get their chubby mits on Bobby's Bon-Bons.

> Can you make me some sort of promotional interactive app experience for all this?

We have received this brief from the client - what do we do with it? Where do we start?

The client has said I want a thing that does this:

  - this is the business requirement that we must meet. 

So how can we define this in a way that makes sense - something that we can take action on.

- What's the definition of success?
    - i.e. what in terms *lacking any form* does the client want to achieve?
    - i.e. what does the client think the form of the solution should be? 
- What's the definition of failure?
    - i.e. 
    - e.g. It's a website but it doesn't help anyone find the information they're looking for. 




#### This is Out Design Problem

**So what's the solution?**


### Whoa Buddy.
**let's not jump ahead of outselves.**

With any design project, we need to break this problem down into as granular parts aspossible. 

**What can we discern from the client about their customers? **

######We have to consider the users in as holistic a way as possible
- ie. there are a plethora of users 
    - from the business owner themselves to the person buying their service (the only difference being that some interests take precedence over others). 
- ie. not just what the users want to achieve on the platform but also how they are going to be using it 
    - technically (what devices, what browser) and physically (are they sight-impaired? are they using 5 fingers or 1 thumb?)

Now

1. balance the business requirements against the users requirements. 

- How is this made into problems that need a solution
discover the users - define them
    how can we turn that into features and points of design?
